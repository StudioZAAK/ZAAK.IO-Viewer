# ZAAK.IO Viewer

The Viewer of http://zaak.io is build upon Boris Smus WebVR Boilerplate.
https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate

It has a lot of add-ons that work seamless with the scenes you can create on http://www.zaak.io/editor/.
It has raycaster, a HUD with crosshair as well as three different navigation types.

MoveTo Navigation : Look at an object and move over there (Smooth Transition)
JumpTo Navigation : Look at an object and get teleported to another object you set in space (Direct Transition)
HomeButton : If you move away from 0/0/0 the homebutton will appear and bring you back to 0/0/0
